### This repo includes:
  1. The script to scrap the data from the Dark Souls 1,2,3 and Demon Souls wiki
  
  2. The script to run the neural network
  
  3. The .zip data if you just want to have a quick go on the neural net 

The scraping is not perfect and I missed a couple of swords. A couple of misc. icons got in as well and had to be removed manually.
Not much tinkering has been done model-wise so feel free to play around with data augmentation, scraping improvement and hyperparameter tuning.

*Note: A B&W version is available for training purposes. The performance is obviously poor.*
